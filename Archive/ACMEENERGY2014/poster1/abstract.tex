Fuel consumption in automobiles depends on a number of factors: speed, terrain, engine load and driving behavior are just some of them. Accurate estimation of future fuel consumption is vital for not only the scheduling of refueling stops, but also for the choice of routes for the budget- and/or environmentally-conscious. In this study, we demonstrate a least-squares regression model on data we gathered in an on-road, multi-driver experiment to predict the fuel consumption for a given driver along a route on which they have not previously traveled, given their driving data along other routes, and the modeling of driving routes using other drivers' data along them. Using this technique, we can eliminate the assumptions and extrapolations in trip fuel consumption estimation, replacing them with socially-enhanced modeling based on real-life historical data on a diverse set of drivers, vehicles and routes.
