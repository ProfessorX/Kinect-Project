\section{Discussion and Future Work} \label{sec:future}

The accuracy of the prediction is limited by the number of training routes, which is in turn limited by the number of drivers. However, the data acquisition system we developed for use in this experiment has been linked to the CloudThink platform \cite{CT:WP:2013}, which is being expanded to include a network of diverse automobile data acquisition devices. Apart from the data gathered by running more experiments of our own, we will be acquiring more data from this platform as its user base expands. More data from more drivers over the same routes, and in different climactic and traffic conditions, will help us address the paucity of data and the short, low-consumption trips in the experiments adversely affecting the accuracy of fuel consumption prediction in this particular demonstration.
