Distance-to-Empty (DTE) in vehicles depends on several uncertain factors, such as speed, terrain, traffic and driving behavior. Accurate estimation of DTE is vital for not only the scheduling for refueling, but also for the choice of routes for the budget- and/or environmentally-conscious. Traditional approaches often rely on a single driver's personal history. In this paper, we explore a social approach by using other drivers' data to predict the fuel consumption for a given driver along a new route that is not traveled previously. We develop a least-squares regression model and corroborate the performance empirically by an on-road, multi-driver experiment. Our results can enable a new kind of social platform for trip planning based on the shared data among drivers.
