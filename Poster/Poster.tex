\begin{abstract}
  Nowadays, most building air-conditioning systems still operate on a
  fixed schedule rather than real-time occupancy. In our study, we
  make an occupancy tracking software based on Kinect to reflect the
  number of people in a open lab. We then build a Markov Chain (MC)
  model after dividing the open area into 4 zones and calculating its
  occupancy respectively. When applying the real-time schedule of one
  week to a building model created with eQuest, we obtain a 22.1\%
  energy reduction in space cooling.
